Final-P1: Volume of 5-D Superellipsoids
========

The purpose of this program is to use Monte Carlo integration to calculate the volumes of 5-D superellipsoids.
The formula is given as:

x1^n + x2^n + x3^n + x4^n + x5^n = 1
    (for n = 1, 2,...,9)
    

Volume of 5-D Superellipsoid vs n

The vertical axis is the volume, and the horizontal axis the parameter n. As seen in the plot, as the value of n 
increases, the volume of the superellipsoid approached the volume of the cube that contains it (Cube volume = 32).
